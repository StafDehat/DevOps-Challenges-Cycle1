// __Challenge 4__:
// Write a script that creates a Cloud Files Container. If the container already exists, exit and let the user know. The script should also upload a directory from the local filesystem to the new container, and enable CDN for the new container. The script must return the CDN URL. This must be done in PHP with php-opencloud.
